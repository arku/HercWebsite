            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the collection and use of personal data by
            websites owned or operated by Anthem Vault, Inc. and our affiliates
            (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Anthem Vault”), including without limitation,
            this website and any other website that we may own or operate currently or in the
            future (collectively, the “Website”). By viewing, accessing, navigating,
            or otherwise using the Website, you (the “User”) agree to the use of your
            personal and other information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
            We are the sole owner of the information collected on this Website.
            We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different
            from what is disclosed in this statement. We collect information from our users
            in several different ways on our Website as described more specifically below.</p>
            <h2>Registration</h2>
            <p>
                In order to use certain portions of the Website or receive certain
                services offered by the Website such as to register for an account
                via the Website (“User Account”), a user must first complete a registration form.
                During registration a user is required to give his or her contact information
                (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user
                about the services on our Website for which he or she has expressed interest.
            </p>
            <h2>Transactions</h2>
            <p>
                In areas of our Website that provide online transactions with us,
                we request information from the user to process the purchase order.
                Here, a user may be required to provide personal information
                (like name and mailing address) and financial information
                (like bank account numbers). This information is used to fill
                customer’s’ orders and satisfy any regulatory requirements we have.
                If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is
                used to get in touch with the user.
            </p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s personal computer hard
                drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no
                way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Website.
                Once the user closes his or her computer web browser, the cookie terminates.
                For instance, by setting a cookie on our Website, the user would not have to
                log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Website
                during repeat visits. If a user rejects the cookie by setting the browser to
                reject cookies, the user may still use our Website, but as a result the user
                would be limited in some areas of our Website. Cookies also can enable us to
                track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website.
            </p>
            <h2>Log Files</h2>
            <p>
                As is the case for most websites, we automatically obtain and store in our
                log files certain general information such as IP addresses, browser type,
                Internet service provider, page path and other web analytics to improve user
                experience, analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement on our
                pages, and gather broad demographic information. None of the information
                stored in our log files is linked to personally identifiable information.
            </p>
            <h2>Sharing</h2>
            <p>
                We treat all personal information provided by a user and held by us as
                confidential and will not disclose any such information to any third
                party except as specified in this paragraph. We will not sell, rent, loan
                or trade any of your personal information provided to us.<br>
                We may use another company’s services to verify your personal
                information as a requirement for making transactions through your User Account.
                Any such company is authorized to use this information solely for
                the purpose of verifying your personal information on our behalf and for
                no other purpose, and will not store any personally sensitive data
                not in the public domain.<br>
                We use third-party analytics tools to track general, non-personally
                identifiable information such as pages viewed, browser type and
                aggregated demographic information to help measure and improve overall
                user experience. Any such information is not linked to any personal information
                that can identify any individual person.<br>
                We may partner with other companies to provide specific services to users.
                If and when the user agrees to applicable terms and signs up for any such
                services, we will share names or other personal information that is necessary
                for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not
                allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the
                purpose of providing these services.
            </p>
            <h2>Links</h2>
            <p>
                This Website contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for
                the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to
                be aware when they leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of
                each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.
                This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by us.
            </p>
            <h2>Email and Newsletters</h2>
            <p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters, we ask for contact
            information such as name and email address.</p>
            <h2>Surveys</h2>
            <p>
                From time to time we may request information from users via surveys.
                Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user
                therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
                Information requested may include contact information
                (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information
                (such as zip code, age, etc.). Survey information is used for purposes
                of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of users of the Website.
            </p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the
                correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
                electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
                information we collect online. When users submit sensitive information
                via the Website, the information is protected both online and offline.<br>
                While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online,
                we also take precautions to protect user-information off-line.
                All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information
                mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who
                need the information to perform a specific job are granted access
                to personally identifiable information. Employees are kept up to date
                on our security and privacy practices. The computer servers on which
                we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment,
                behind a firewall and locked door(s). Internet security measures
                are taken to guard against hacking or cracking intrusions, damage
                or theft of information.
            </p>
            <h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
            <p>
                Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or other
                materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying
                to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email.
            </p>
            <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
            <p>
                If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes
                on our home page so our users are aware of what information we collect,
                how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
                We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy according
                to how the information was collected. For any questions regarding our
                privacy policy you may contact us from the Contact Us page.
            </p>
