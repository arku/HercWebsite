            </h4>
            <p>Fact: Current Supply Chain solutions are expensive. It is also a fact that companies with global supply chains could be standing on a cost base of which 90% is attributable to supply chain expenditure. The constant question for entrepreneurs, small companies, and large companies alike is: Can costs be saved by improving, streamlining, and optimizing the supply chain process?</p>

            <p>The industry standard for supply chain management does not currently offer a real-time view of all transactions to all the parties involved in a supply chain. This significant challenge is addressed by Hercules, which is built on the blockchain and enables immutable data to be shared among network participants and updated in real time.</p>

            <p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that supply chains across industries will be reimagined and revamped by using blockchain. This transformational technology offers a much safer and more transparent way to connect businesses and track and/or exchange any type of asset. Blockchains offer a solution to the growing problem of managing sophisticated networks of manufacturers and suppliers.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>Supply chain management involves planning, implementing and controlling supply chain operations, which typically include the movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory and finished goods from the point-of-origin to the point-of-consumption. The difficulty, however, comes with trying to find the best supply chain configuration that enables operations to be run efficiently and responsively.</p>

            <p>Blockchain technology creates many possibilities within the supply chain space. From a historical view, the industrial era brought about the centralization of production. Mass manufacturing, for example, helped make centralized production more efficient. This centralization came in the form of large factories where raw commodities were turned into finished goods.</p>
