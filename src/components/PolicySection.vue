            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Hercules SEZC (HERC) respects your privacy. We will never willfully disclose individually identifiable
                 information about our customers to any third party, except in the limited circumstances permitted
                  by this policy.</p>
            <p>HERC does not sell, rent, or loan any personally identifiable information regarding its customers
                 to any third party. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security, and 
                 will not be used in ways to which you have not consented.</p>
            <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies solely to information collected through the HERC family
                 of websites, web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs and their respective
                  contents at the following URLs: including herc.one, in addition to Twitter, Facebook or other social
                   networking sites, and their respective contents, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or
                    other technology (collectively, the “Sites”). The Sites are offered by HERC and its subsidiary and
                     affiliated companies, Site developers and other promotional partners (collectively, “HERC,” or “we”, “us”, “our”).</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information may be collected through the Sites, how such information may be used and/or shared
                 with others, how we safeguard it and how you may access and control its use in connection with our marketing
                  communications and activities. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, because by using the Sites you
                   are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In addition, please
                    review our Terms of Use, which governs your use of the Sites and any content you submit to the Sites.</p>
            <h2>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US</h2>
            <p>
                The Sites may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify
                 you personally (such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, or home address
                  (“Personal Information”)). For example, HERC may collect Personal Information when you register on the
                   Sites, request information, submit comments or participate in some promotion, survey or other feature
                    of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us. The Sites may also ask you to provide other
                     information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain
                      information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic or other information we
                       collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as
                        Personal Information. To the extent the Sites allow you to apply to become a customer of HERC,
                         additional information may be requested and collected from you via customer application forms
                          and other forms. If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it.
            </p>
            <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY</h2>
            <p>
                Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites, HERC, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service
                 providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how
                  the Sites are accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type,
                   operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views. This statistical data provides us
                    with information about the use of the Sites, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites,
                     how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. This information helps
                      us keep our website fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor’s interests.
                       Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if HERC associates it with you as a specific and
                        identifiable person, HERC treats it as Personal Information.
            </p>
            <p>HERC also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the
                 computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Sites.
                  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website
                   or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.</p>

                   <p>The technologies used on the Sites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include,
                        without limitation, cookies and pixel tags, described below:</p>
            <p>Cookies are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites. HERC, or our third-party advertising service providers,
                 may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience
                  while visiting our Sites. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Sites
                   and pages visited. Cookies also allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them
                    while you are on the Sites. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive
                     a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies. However, please
                      be aware that some features and services on our Sites may not work properly because we may not be able to
                       recognize and associate you with your HERC account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you
                        visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.</p>
            <p>A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed. In addition,
                 a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server. In order to ensure the safekeeping
                  of your information, network advertising companies and publishers are not permitted to directly
                   collect Personal Information on our Sites.</p>
            <h2>ANALYTICS</h2>
            <p>HERC may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.  Google
                 Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google
                  uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google
                   services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own
                    advertising network.
            </p>
            <p>You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing
                 the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript
                  (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.

                 example, to: respond to your questions and requests; provide you with access to certain areas and features
                  of the Sites; verify your identity; communicate with you about your account and activities on the Sites
                   and, in our discretion, changes to any HERC policy; tailor content, advertisements, and offers we serve

            </p>
            <h2>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any
                 third parties without your specific consent. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate
                  user statistics, demographic information, and Usage Information with third parties. We may also share
                   your information as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy
                    Policy and in the following circumstances:
            </p>
            <h3>Third party service providers</h3>
            <p>In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and materials available to you through the Sites, and to respond to your
                 inquiries, we may share your Personal Information, or Usage Information with third parties that perform functions on
                  our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that: host or operate our
                   Sites; analyze data; provide customer service; advertisers; sponsors or other third parties that participate
                    in or administer our promotions or provide marketing or promotional assistance (such as in connection with winner selection,
                     prize fulfillment, and as required by law, such as on a winners list).</p>
            <h3>Your agreement</h3>
            <p>While on our Sites, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers
                 from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party. If you
                  agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to the third
                   party and the Personal Information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices
                    of that third party.</p>
            <h3>Transactions</h3>
            <p>Your Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates and other
                 entities in the family of companies controlled by HERC for internal reasons, primarily for business
                  and operational purposes. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets.
                   If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to the
                    Sites, Personal Information, Usage Information, and any other information that we have collected about
                     the users of the Sites may be disclosed to such entity as part of the due diligence process and will
                      be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or
                       reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an
                        asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.</p>
            <h3>Legal reasons</h3>
            <p>HERC may transfer and disclose information, including your Personal Information, Usage Information and
                 Device Identifier (including IP address), to third parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we
                  believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an
                   investigation; to verify or enforce our User Agreement or other applicable policies; to respond to an
                    emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties, visitors
                     to our Sites or the public.</p>
            <h2>INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES</h2>
            <p>HERC may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another website
                 and you opt-in to receive information from HERC, that website will forward to us your e-mail address
                  and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to
                   participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications
                    or a similar application or feature on a third party website) through which you allow us to collect
                     (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. In addition,
                      we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to
                       their profiles and you are one of their “connections” or information about you is otherwise
                        accessible through your “connections” web page, profile page, or similar page on a social
                         networking or other third party website or interactive service.</p>
            <p>We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the Sites with outside records
                 from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and
                  to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to
                   you. We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we collect
                    through the Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information
                     received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>
            <h2>OPTING OUT</h2>
            <p>
                You may always direct us not to share your Personal Information with third parties, not to use your
                 Personal Information to provide you with information or offers, or not to send you newsletters,
                  e-mails or other communications by: (i) sending us an e-mail at _________________ with the word
                   “Remove” as the subject header; (ii) calling us at (___) ______; or (iii) following the removal
                    instructions in the communication that you receive. Your opt-out request will be processed within
                     30 days of the date on which we receive it.
            </p>
            <p>If you wish to verify, correct, or update any of your personal information collected through the Sites,
                 you may edit your profile preferences or us at the above address or e-mail. In accordance with our routine
                  record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through
                   the Sites. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability
                    arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. In addition, you should be aware
                     that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases
                      without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.</p>
            <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
                 Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals,
                  we do not respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry
                   to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.</p>
            <h2>HOW TO OPT-OUT</h2>
            <p>HERC licenses technology to serve advertisements on its own Sites and within its content as that
                 content is served across the Internet. In addition, HERC may use third party network advertisers to
                  serve advertisements and third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about
                   the use of the Sites and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these third
                    parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or analytics service providers
                     may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your Device and they may
                      otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information. We and our
                       network advertisers may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be
                        interested based on your visits to both the Sites and other websites. We may use a variety of
                         companies to serve advertisements.
            </p>
            <p>If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt out of some network advertising programs
                 that use your information. To do so please visit the NAI Opt-Out Page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>
            <p>Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements
                 while you are browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your
                  interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest
                   categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine
                    the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies
                     its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.</p>

            <h2>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                We use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information. However, no
                 electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please
                  note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you
                   use the Sites and provide us with your information at your own risk.
            </p>

                on our home page so our users are aware of what information we collect,
                how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
