                 You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to your use of this Website or

            <h2>Resolution of Disputes</h2>
            <p>Prior to the initiation of any legal action arising from these Terms of Use or your use of the Website,
                 you agree to mediate the dispute as provided below. The mediation shall be held in George Town, Grand
                  Cayman, Cayman Islands. The mediator shall be selected by you from a list of three qualified mediators
                   provided by us, from which you shall be entitled to select one. At least 5 days prior to the commencement
                    of the mediation, you agree to deposit the sum of $5,000.00 to be held in escrow by the mediator until
                     the mediation is complete. Upon completion of the mediation, regardless of the result, the mediator
                      shall return to you the $5,000.00 deposit, minus one half of the expenses charged by the mediator for
                       the mediation. In the event that the mediation does not result in an amicable resolution of your
                        claims, then you are free to file suit in a court as provided herein.</p>
            <p>The prevailing party in any such action shall be entitled to receive its, his, or her reasonable attorneys’
                 fees and costs from the non-prevailing party. The conditions set forth herein shall be mandatory and
                  shall act as a pre-requisite to filing any lawsuit or other legal action. If the conditions precedent
                   are not met prior to your filing a lawsuit, then you consent and stipulate to a dismissal of your action
                    and agree not to re-file until such time as all conditions precedent have been satisfied. Nothing in
                     this paragraph shall serve as an express or implied waiver of the applicable statute of limitations
                      and shall not be used by you as a defense to an untimely assertion of your claims.</p>

            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and us as it pertains to your use of
                 the Website and supersede any prior agreements between you and us. These Terms of Use shall be read
                  and interpreted in conjunction with our Privacy Policy and any additional agreements between you and
                   us. Where there is any conflict between the terms of these documents, these Terms of Use will
                    supersede all others.</p>
            <p>We will not be liable for any failure to perform any obligation under these Terms of Use as the
                 result of an event beyond our control, including, but not limited to, any act of God, terrorism,
                  war, political insurgence, insurrection, riot, civil unrest, act of civil or military authority,
                   uprising, earthquake, flood, or any other natural or man-made eventuality outside our control.</p>
            <p>The failure of you or us to insist on strict performance or to exercise any right or remedy hereunder
                 shall not constitute a waiver thereof and shall not cause a diminution of the obligations under these
                  Terms of Use. No waiver shall be effective unless it is expressly stated in writing, signed by the waiving
                   party. If one or more provisions of these Terms of Use are held to be unenforceable under applicable law,
                    such provision shall be excluded and the balance of the Terms of Use shall be interpreted as if
                     such provision were so excluded and shall be otherwise enforceable in accordance with its terms.</p>
