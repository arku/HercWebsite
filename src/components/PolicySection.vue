            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Hercules SEZC (HERC) respects your privacy. We will never willfully disclose individually identifiable
                 information about our customers to any third party, except in the limited circumstances permitted
                  by this policy.</p>
            <p>HERC does not sell, rent, or loan any personally identifiable information regarding its customers
                 to any third party. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security, and 
                 will not be used in ways to which you have not consented.</p>
            <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies solely to information collected through the HERC family
                 of websites, web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs and their respective
                  contents at the following URLs: including herc.one, in addition to Twitter, Facebook or other social
                   networking sites, and their respective contents, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or
                    other technology (collectively, the “Sites”). The Sites are offered by HERC and its subsidiary and
                     affiliated companies, Site developers and other promotional partners (collectively, “HERC,” or “we”, “us”, “our”).</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information may be collected through the Sites, how such information may be used and/or shared
                 with others, how we safeguard it and how you may access and control its use in connection with our marketing
                  communications and activities. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, because by using the Sites you
                   are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In addition, please
                    review our Terms of Use, which governs your use of the Sites and any content you submit to the Sites.</p>
            <h2>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US</h2>
            <p>
                The Sites may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify
                 you personally (such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, or home address
                  (“Personal Information”)). For example, HERC may collect Personal Information when you register on the
                   Sites, request information, submit comments or participate in some promotion, survey or other feature
                    of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us. The Sites may also ask you to provide other
                     information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, zip code, age, etc.) or certain
                      information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic or other information we
                       collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as
                        Personal Information. To the extent the Sites allow you to apply to become a customer of HERC,
                         additional information may be requested and collected from you via customer application forms
                          and other forms. If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it.
            </p>
            <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY</h2>
            <p>
                Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites, HERC, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service
                 providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how
                  the Sites are accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type,
                   operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views. This statistical data provides us
                    with information about the use of the Sites, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites,
                     how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. This information helps
                      us keep our website fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor’s interests.
                       Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if HERC associates it with you as a specific and
                        identifiable person, HERC treats it as Personal Information.
            </p>
            <p>HERC also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the
                 computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Sites.
                  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website
                   or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.</p>

                   <p>The technologies used on the Sites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include,
                        without limitation, cookies and pixel tags, described below:</p>
            <p>Cookies are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites. HERC, or our third-party advertising service providers,
                 may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience
                  while visiting our Sites. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Sites
                   and pages visited. Cookies also allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them
                    while you are on the Sites. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive
                     a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies. However, please
                      be aware that some features and services on our Sites may not work properly because we may not be able to
                       recognize and associate you with your HERC account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you
                        visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.</p>
            <p>A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed. In addition,
                 a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server. In order to ensure the safekeeping
                  of your information, network advertising companies and publishers are not permitted to directly
                   collect Personal Information on our Sites.</p>
            <h2>ANALYTICS</h2>
            <p>HERC may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.  Google
                 Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google
                  uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google
                   services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own
                    advertising network.
            </p>
            <p>You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing
                 the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript
                  (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.

            <h2>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
            <p>HERC uses the information we collect about and from you for a variety of business purposes, including for
                 example, to: respond to your questions and requests; provide you with access to certain areas and features
                  of the Sites; verify your identity; communicate with you about your account and activities on the Sites
                   and, in our discretion, changes to any HERC policy; tailor content, advertisements, and offers we serve

            </p>
            <h2>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
                Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any
                 third parties without your specific consent. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate
                  user statistics, demographic information, and Usage Information with third parties. We may also share
                   your information as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy
                    Policy and in the following circumstances:
            </p>
            <h3>Third party service providers</h3>
            <h2>Email and Newsletters</h2>
            <p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters, we ask for contact
            information such as name and email address.</p>
            <h2>Surveys</h2>
            <p>
                From time to time we may request information from users via surveys.
                Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user
                therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
                Information requested may include contact information
                (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information
                (such as zip code, age, etc.). Survey information is used for purposes
                of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of users of the Website.
            </p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the
                correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
                electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the
                information we collect online. When users submit sensitive information
                via the Website, the information is protected both online and offline.<br>
                While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online,
                we also take precautions to protect user-information off-line.
                All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information
                mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who
                need the information to perform a specific job are granted access
                to personally identifiable information. Employees are kept up to date
                on our security and privacy practices. The computer servers on which
                we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment,
                behind a firewall and locked door(s). Internet security measures
                are taken to guard against hacking or cracking intrusions, damage
                or theft of information.
            </p>
            <h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
            <p>
                Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or other
                materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying
                to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email.
            </p>
            <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
            <p>
                If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes
                on our home page so our users are aware of what information we collect,
                how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
                We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy according
                to how the information was collected. For any questions regarding our
                privacy policy you may contact us from the Contact Us page.
            </p>
